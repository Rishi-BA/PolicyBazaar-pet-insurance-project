# PolicyBazaar Pet Insurance Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete **business analysis and solution design** for adding a **Pet Insurance** product to the PolicyBazaar platform.  
It demonstrates the **full BA documentation lifecycle** — from requirements gathering to traceability and testing — for a real-world product feature enhancement.

---

## 🏦 Problem Statement
PolicyBazaar currently offers:
- Health Insurance
- Life Insurance
- Automobile Insurance

While leading in individual and family insurance markets, PolicyBazaar is missing opportunities in the **pet insurance** segment.  
Competitors offering pet coverage are attracting customers, resulting in:
- Loss of revenue
- Reduced market share
- Lower customer engagement

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Integrate a **Pet Insurance** category into the existing PolicyBazaar website:
- Coverage for **cats and dogs** of any breed
- Hassle-free claims for treatments, vaccinations, and checkups
- Seamless purchase via the existing payment gateway
- Instant confirmation popup and email with policy document
